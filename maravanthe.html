                <strong>Maravanthe Beach</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Maravanthe Beach is a serene gem nestled along Karnataka’s west coast, offering a unique and
                unforgettable experience with its remarkable geography. The stretch of NH66 that passes through
                Maravanthe is a sight to behold, with the glistening Arabian Sea on one side and the serene Suparnika
                River on the other. The beach is ideal for those seeking tranquility, as its relatively untouched sands
                and calm waves create an idyllic escape from the bustle of city life. A walk along the shoreline, with
                the sound of waves crashing against the sand and the breeze carrying the scent of saltwater, is both
                soothing and rejuvenating. The Suparnika River, winding through lush green landscapes before merging
                into the sea, offers a scenic setting for boating and leisurely exploration. Additionally, Maravanthe is
                a gateway to nearby attractions, such as the ancient Kollur Mookambika Temple and the Kodachadri Hills,
                which provide opportunities for spiritual and adventurous pursuits alike.

                <strong>Malpe Beach</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Malpe Beach, on the other hand, is a dynamic and vibrant destination, perfect for those who enjoy a mix
                of leisure and adventure. Located just 6 kilometers from the cultural town of Udupi, Malpe Beach is
                known for its golden-white sands, turquoise waters, and bustling activities. Visitors can indulge in a
                variety of water sports, including parasailing, jet skiing, speed boating, and surfing, making it a hub
                for thrill-seekers. The beach also caters to relaxation, with plenty of shaded spots under swaying palm
                trees where one can unwind with a book or enjoy the scenic views. A visit to Malpe Beach is incomplete
                without taking a ferry ride to St. Mary’s Island, a UNESCO-recognized heritage site famous for its
                striking hexagonal basalt rock formations formed by ancient volcanic activity. The island’s
                crystal-clear waters and unspoiled beauty make it an ideal spot for picnics and photography. Malpe Beach
                also has a rich cultural vibe, with local fishermen heading out to sea in traditional boats and colorful
                beach shacks serving a variety of fresh seafood, including Udupi’s signature coastal delicacies. Whether
                you’re watching a vibrant sunset or participating in the Malpe Beach Festival held annually, this
                destination guarantees a memorable experience.
